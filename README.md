# Algo Practice

Algo Practice is a web application where you can manually enter numbers in order to 'simulate' how a sorting algorithm works. 

## Why should I use this application?

I think Algo Practice will help you to visualize each pass of algorithm.  I built Algo Practice because I used to write these passes on paper and I spent a lot of papers. Also, it's really hard to easily do this in text programs like Notepad and VS Code (even if you use tabs instead of spaces).

## Getting Started

Algo Practice is hosted on algo-practice.dbmilos.com. You can also clone this repo and run it locally (on your computer). 

## How to use?

When you open the app, enter how many numbers you have to sort and click OK.

After that you will see a row of (N) inputs, and you can fill them with your numbers.

Then click on 'Add new' and this will add another row of inputs, and this is actually a first pass of the algorithm. You should enter here what happens at this point. Repeat this process until you sort numbers.
